# development
First pass development: the intial work file for the Cliptionary project.

The objects are:

1. To establish a quick-and-dirty implementation of the Cliptionary project as quickly as possible using:
- HTML5 with Bootstrap
- Firebase
- Firestore / Cloud Storage
2. To test and measure traction using Traction methods measured by Firebase to see if this is a good idea.*

At this first pass two of us are working remotely. We should speak regularly over Skype and use GitHub to organise our workflow.



*Good idea = something people want to use and will pay for.
